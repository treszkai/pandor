# AND-OR search algorithm for finite state controllers in a probabilistic environment

Master's thesis of Laszlo Treszkai at the University of Edinburgh, MSc in AI, 2018.

_(work in progress)_  

Repository structure:

 - `source`
   - `dandor.py`: The algorithm for environments that are deterministic or uncertain. Proof sketched for correctness, well-tested.
   - `pandor.py`: The algorithm for noisy environments. **Work in progress.** 
   - `environments.py`: Definitions of environments.
